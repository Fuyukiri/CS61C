//Determines what color the cell at the given row/col should be. This function allocates space for a new Color.
//Note that you will need to read the eight neighbors of the cell in question. The grid "wraps", so we treat the top row as adjacent to the bottom row
//and the left column as adjacent to the right column.

//The main body of Life; given an image and a rule, computes one iteration of the Game of Life.
//You should be able to copy most of this from steganography.c

	//YOUR CODE HERE
}

/*
Loads a .ppm from a file, computes the next iteration of the game of life, then prints to stdout the new image.

argc stores the number of arguments.
argv stores a list of arguments. Here is the expected input:
argv[0] will store the name of the program (this happens automatically).
argv[1] should contain a filename, containing a .ppm.
argv[2] should contain a hexadecimal number (such as 0x1808). Note that this will be a string.
You may find the function strtol useful for this conversion.
If the input is not correct, a malloc fails, or any other error occurs, you should exit with code -1.
Otherwise, you should return from main with code 0.
Make sure to free all memory before returning!

You may find it useful to copy the code from steganography.c, to start.
