To get the program running, first need to install cunit:
```
sudo apt-get install libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev
```
Since 2022, python3.6 is no longer supported

please update the makefile to `PYTHON = -I/usr/include/python3.8 -lpython3.8`

Since we can't get dumbpy package, so I wrote one for test

using following command to install dumbpy
```
make install_dumb
```

# numc
