# =======================================================
# FUNCTION: Get the squared difference of 2 int arrays,
#   store in a third array and compute the sum
# Arguments:
#   a0 (int*) is the pointer to the start of arr0
#   a1 (int*) is the pointer to the start of arr1
#   a2 (int)  is the length of the arrays
#   a3 (int*) is the pointer to the start of the loss array

# Returns:
#   a0 (int)  is the sum of the squared loss
# Exceptions:
# - If the length of the array is less than 1,
#   this function terminates the program with error code 36.
